1.3.2
====== 

- white space and braces cleanups
- fixup confusion on ERR_PTR vs. NULL (fixes Oopsen)
- make anyting static that can be
  - functions
  - variables (and remove redundany 0 initialization for static vars)
  - use static initializers for things like semaphores, lists, locks
  - remove set_digsig_ops/security_set_operations in favor of
    statically initiaized digsig_security_ops
- name change digsig_attribute_st -> digsig_attribute
- introduce DIGSIG_ATTR macro, and use for attribute initialization
- change names of sysfs files (in module, and hopefully supporting scripts
  and programs)
  - digsig_interface -> key
  - digsig_revoke -> revoke
- move extern defs to header files
- move towards single point of return (goto and error cleanup)
- fixup memory leaks on error return paths
- move towards use of error values rather than just -1
- move ctx cleanup out of digsig_sign_verify_final so that caller is
  responsible (less confusion and no chance of double free on error
  cleanup)
- use security_initcall()
- remove unneeded digsig_init_revocation (list statically initialized now)
- remove inline on external functions
- use list_for_each_entry
- collapse 'n' and 'e' cases in digsig_key_store for raw_public_key allocation
- remove redundant file->f_security = NULL after digsig_allow_write_access()
- move list_add_tail() in dsi_sysfs for revoked key into digsig_revocation.c
  under helper digsig_add_revoked_sig()
- add revoked_list_lock (used in above helper) for proper list manipulation
- s/SHA1_TFM/sha1_tfm/ ala CodingStyle
- fix bogus ctx==NULL check in digsig_sign_verify_update()

1.3
==== 
        - Added documentation for digsig 
        - added support for revoked signatures
        - support to avoid vulnerability for rewrite of shared libraries
        - removed some files not used 
        - code clean up, naming standards using digsig every where, and some bug fixing

1.1
====
	-added support for caching of signatures.
1.0
===

	- the verification of signatures for the shared binaries has been
	added. 
	
0.3
===

	- use sysfs to connect to the module instead of the char device 
	
0.2 
=== 

	- the main change is that we now use a script to launch the
	module, the module doesn't read the public key file. We use a
	small c program to read the public key and feed it into the module
	using a char device.




0.1
=====
	- Initial release.
