uClinux/distribution SOURCE
---------------------------

The sources in this build have come from many places.
Primarily from www.uclinux.org and cvs.uclinux.org

The directories:

linux-2.0.x --
linux-2.4.x -- uClinux sources from cvs.uclinux.org

freeswan    -- FreeSWAN 1.97 from www.freeswan.org

lib         -- User application libraries. Includes libc, libm and others.

uClibc      -- An alternate libc from www.uClibc.org

user        -- User mode applications, source from many places.
               Too many places to enumerate, many are standard GNU/Linux
               packages, all are freely available on the net somewhere.

The following directories hold results of the build process:

config      -- Basically a version of the linux config scripts that are
               used to drive the vendor/platform configuration.

vendors     -- holds plaform specific build information or support files.
               This is also the location where default build configurations
               are kept for each of the supported platforms.

romfs       -- Is the structrue of the ROM based file system. Mostly it
               holds the user application binaries, but also has device nodes.

images      -- Contains the final build binaries of the kernel, ROM file
               system, and the complete combined image.
