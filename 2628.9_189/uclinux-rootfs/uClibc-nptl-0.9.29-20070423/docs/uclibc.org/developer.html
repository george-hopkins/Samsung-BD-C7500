<h3>Subversion Read/Write Access</h3>

To obtain commit access, you will need to demonstrate you are serious by
submitting a few good patches first.  Then, you will need to select a username
to use when committing changes to SVN, you will need to send me the username
you have selected, you must send me your preferred contact email address, and
finally, you must send me an ssh version 2 DSA key with 1024 bits (the default)
or more.  If you do not currently have an ssh version 2 DSA key, you can
generate a key using the command<pre>ssh-keygen -t dsa</pre>  This will
create the files <pre>/home/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/.ssh/id_dsa
/home/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</pre>  You must then send the content
of 'id_dsa.pub' to me so I can setup your account.  The content of 'id_dsa'
should of course be kept secret.

<p>

Note that if you would prefer to keep your communications with me
private, you can encrypt your email using my
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/gpg.asc">public key</a>.

<p>

Once you are setup with an account, you will need to use your account to
checkout a copy of uClibc from Subversion:

<pre>
svn list svn+ssh://username@svn.uclibc.org/svn/trunk/uClibc</pre>
<br>
It goes without saying you must change <em>username</em> to your own
username...
<p>

You can then enter the newly checked out uClibc directory, make changes, check
your changes, diff your changes, revert your changes, and and commit your
changes usine commands such as:

<pre>
svn diff
svn status
svn revert
svn commit</pre>

<p>
