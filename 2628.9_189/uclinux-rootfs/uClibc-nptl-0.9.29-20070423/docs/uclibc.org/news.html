    <li> <b>17 August 2005, uClibc 0.9.28 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the release of uClibc 0.9.28.
    You are probably used to this by now, but this release is NOT binary
    compatible with uClibc 0.9.27 or any earlier release, so be prepared to
    recompile your software if you are still using an old version of uClibc.

    <p>

    Updated uClibc development systems built using uClibc 0.9.28, along
    with the <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">uClibc buildroot</a>
    and source code used to compile these development systems will be released
    later this evening, along with
    <a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/">Linux Test Project test suite</a>
    results demonstrating how uClibc is doing.  Contributions of LTP test
    suite run results using uClibc are welcome...

    <p>

    As usual the
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.28.tar.bz2">source code for this release</a>
    is available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.

    <li><b>13 January 2005 -- Bug and Patch Tracking</b><p>

    Bug reports sometimes get lost when posted to the mailing list.  The
    developers of uClibc are busy people, and have only so much they can keep
    in their brains at a time. In my case, I'm lucky if I can remember my own
    name, much less a bug report posted last week... To prevent your bug report
    from getting lost, if you find a bug in uClibc, please use the
    <a href="http://bugs.uclibc.org/">shiny new Bug and Patch Tracking System</a>
    to post all the gory details.

    <p>

    The same applies to patches... Regardless of whether your patch
    is a bug fix or adds spiffy new features, please post your patch
    to the Bug and Patch Tracking System to make certain it is
    properly considered.
