<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Note for embedded Linux users: The trace daemon is run on the target system.</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The tracedaemon program is the daemon component of Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT). Its
primary function is to collect the data from the trace module in the kernel and
to commit it to a file. In order to do so, it needs a minimum of 2 arguments:
the file in which to commit the trace and a file to write the description of the system as
found is /proc on startup. The later is used by the data decoder in order to reconstruct
the system as it was when the trace started.  In the case of flight recorder data, however,
only the trace file needs be specified; a proc file isn't generated.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the trace daemon can be used to configure the trace
module by passing it different command line arguments. The trace module is
configured using a series of calls to ioctl(). Contrary to the command line
arguments options possible for the trace decoder, the options given to the daemon
have a direct impact on the data collected by the kernel. That is, if some data
is configured to be omitted then that data will not be available in the raw trace
and cannot be extracted by the decoder. On the other hand if the same is done on
the decoder level, the data might not be present in the decoder's output, but
it will still be available in the raw trace. Therefore, the choice of configuration
of the daemon should be selected with caution, the data omitted being truly omitted
in the trace. You have been warned!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted, the tracedaemon is used to start both normal traces i.e.
traces in which all traced data is logged to disk, and 'flight recorder' traces, which
are traces that run continuously and are only written to disk when requested (see the -j
option below) or are examined after a system crash has taken place (see SGI's LKCD
(Linux Kernel Crash Dump) for tools that allow the retrieval of the flight recorder
buffers in a post-mortem situation).  The default set of events that are logged in flight
recorder mode are: syscall entry/exit, trap entry/exit, irq entry/exit, schedchange,
kernel timer, softirq, and process.  Note that all of these events, except for kernel
timer, softirq and process, are required to display a trace graphically using the LTT
visual tools.

<p><b>OPTIONS</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-d</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the trace module to it's
default configuration. It is wise to always include this options since it makes
sure that the trace module is set to it's default configuration even if it
has already been used by a previous run of the daemon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-p</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Print the current trace
mask. When the trace daemon is already running, simply call on <b>tracedaemon -p</b>
to print the current trace mask. You won't need to provide the daemon with any
other option whatsoever. You don't even need to provide the link to the current
trace device.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-m</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify the curren trace
mask. When the trace daemon is already running, use this option with the
-e or -D options to modify the curren trace mask. As with -p, you don't need
to provide any of the traditionnaly required files.


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-f</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the lock-free
tracing scheme.  If -b and/or -n are unspecified, the defaults will be
4 buffers of 512 K each.  The lock-free scheme is the default so this
option need not be used, but is maintained for backward compatibility.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-l</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the locking
tracing scheme.  If -b and/or -n are unspecified, the defaults will be
2 buffers of 1,000,000 bytes each.  If -l is not specified, the
lock-free scheme will be used with 4 buffers of 512K each.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-o</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Force the use of 
gettimeofday() timestamping.  The default timestamping method is TSC 
timestamping, if the platform supports it, otherwise gettimeofday() 
timestamping is used.  This option avoids TSC timestamping even if the 
platform supports it.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-k</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If specified, the remaining options
refer to the flight recorder trace.  Otherwise, all options refer to the normal trace.
Specifying -k with no other options starts the flight recorder trace, which will run
continuously forever unless stopped using the -q option.  A snapshot of the current
flight recorder trace data can be retrieved using the -j option.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop the flight recorder trace, if
active.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-j</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dump the current flight recorder
trace data into the tracefile specified by the TraceFile option.  If there are multiple
CPUs being traced, the TraceFile name will be used as the base for the multiple
resulting tracefiles. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-v</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display information about the current trace and or flight recorder.  This can be used to verify the status and activity of the flight recorder trace.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-b</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets the trace module's
data collection buffer to the size given by <u>BufSize</u>. Giving too small of
a size will result in a loss of events and too large of a size will result in
lost kernel space. The default size for the locking scheme is 1000000 bytes.  
The default size for the lock-free scheme is 524288 (512K).  For the lock-free
scheme, the size should be a power of 2; if it isn't, it will be rounded down 
to the next lower power of 2.  As of 26/03/2000, the trace module will not 
accept sizes below 1000 bytes.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-n</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets the number of
trace module data collection buffers to the number given by
<u>NBuffers</u>.  The default number of buffers for the lock-free
scheme is 4, and 2 for the locking scheme.  The number of buffers
should be a power of 2; if it isn't, it will be rounded down to the
next lower power of 2.  The maximum number of buffers is 256.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-e</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace only the given events.
This will set the trace mask passed to the module to include the event given
in <u>EventTypes</u>. This option can be used more than once to specify all
the events to be traced. The following is the list of event types traced:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
"START" - Trace start</li>

<li>
"SYS_ENTRY" - System call entry</li>

<li>
"RTLXRTI" - RTAI LXRT-informed layer</li>

</ul>
</ul>


Note that the start trace event is always traced, whether it is configured as such or not.
This is done by the trace module and should not be modified since the trace decoder
needs information included in this first event.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-D</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets the module to record the
details of the event given. See <b>-e</b> for the events available. This too can be
used more than once to specify all the events for which the details are recorded.
The details of the start trace event are always recorded, whether -D is used to
specify this or not. The reason is the same than for the <b>-e</b> option. For the
data decoder to be able to draw the event graph, the following events must have
their details recorded : syscall, irq, trap entry and exit and schedchange.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-c</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace CPU-ID. Only include
events that occurred on <u>CPU-ID</u> in trace.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-P</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace PID. Only include
process number <u>PID</u> in trace.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-G</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace process group. Only include
processes part of <u>PGRP</u> in trace.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-g</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace GID. Only include
processes part of <u>GID</u> in trace.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-u</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trace UID. Only include
processes belonging to <u>UID</u> in trace.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-s</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the syscall EIP fetching
policy. If <b>-sd</b> is used then the instruction pointer (EIP) will be fetched
up the call stack at the given <u>CallDepth</u>. If the EIP has to be fetched
from a certain range then <b>-su</b> and <b>-sl</b> must be used in this sequence.
Each must be followed by a hexadecimal formatted address, 0xXXXXXXXX. These will
be the <u>UpperBound</u> and the <u>LowerBound</u> used to fetch the EIP.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-t</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the time for which the
daemon should run. <b>-ts</b> sets the number of seconds to run to <u>Seconds</u>.
<b>-tu</b> sets the number of microseconds to run to <u>Microseconds</u>.
