<H1 ALIGN=center>Dnsmasq</H1> 
Dnsmasq is small utility designed to provide DNS (domain name) services to a 
small network connected to the internet via a NAT (network address translation,
AKA ip-masquerade) firewall and a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection. 
<P>
Since a NAT firewall will pass DNS queries it's perfectly possible for all the
machines on such a network to be configured to talk directly to the ISP's name
server, and the HOWTO recommends doing exactly that. The advantages of
using dnsmasq instead are:
<DIR>

<LI> 
The DNS configuration of machines behind the firewall is simple and
doesn't depend on the details of the ISP's dns servers
<LI>
Clients which try to do DNS lookups while  a modem link to the
internet is down will time out immediately.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq will serve names from the /etc/hosts file on the firewall
machine: If the names of local machines are there, then they can all
be addressed without having to maintain /etc/hosts on each machine.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq will serve names from the DHCP leases file on the firewall machine:
If machines specify a hostname when they take out a DHCP lease, then they are
addressable in the local DNS.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq caches internet addresses (A records and AAAA records) and address-to-name
mappings (PTR records), reducing the load on upstream servers and
improving performance (especially on modem connections). From version
0.95 the cache honours time-to-live information and removes old
records as they expire. From version 0.996 dnsmasq does negative
caching. From version 1.2 dnsmasq supports IPv6 addresses, both
in its cache and in /etc/hosts.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq can be configured to automatically pick up the addresses of
it's upstream nameservers from ppp or dhcp configuration. It will
automatically reload this information if it changes. This facility
will be of particular interest to maintainers of Linux firewall
distributions since it allows dns configuration to be made automatic.
</LI>
<LI>
On IPv6-enabled boxes, dnsmasq can both talk to upstream servers via IPv6 
and offer DNS service via IPv6. On dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) boxes it talks
both protocols and can even act as IPv6-to-IPv4 or IPv4-to-IPv6 forwarder.
</LI>
</DIR>
<P>
Dnsmasq has one further feature; it can be configured to return an MX record 
for the firewall host. This makes it easy to configure the mailer on the local 
machines to forward all mail to the central mailer on the firewall host. Never 
lose root messages from your machines again!

<H2>Download.</H2>

Download dnsmasq <A HREF="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/"> here</A>. 
The tarball includes this documentation, source, manpage and control files for building .rpms.
There are also pre-built i386 .rpms, and a 
<A HREF="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/CHANGELOG"> CHANGELOG</A>.
Dnsmasq is part of the Debian distribution, it can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/dnsmasq/"> here</A> or installed using <TT>apt</TT>.

<H2>Installation.</H2>
To compile and install dnsmasq, the following command (as root) is enough.

<PRE>
make install
</PRE>

On non-Linux machines, you might want to edit config.h. Dnsmasq has
been run on (at least) AIX 4.1.5, FreeBSD 4.4 and Tru64 4.x 

Dnsmasq should be run on your firewall machine (the machine with the modem or other connection to your ISP.)

Put the binary in <TT>/usr/local/sbin/dnsmasq</TT> (running <TT>make install</TT>  will do this) and arrange for it
to be started at boot time.

Note that dnsmasq needs to run as root, since it binds privileged ports. It will drop root priviliges after start-up. Dnsmasq
logs problems using the syslog facility as a daemon.
<P>
<H2>Building rpms.</H2>
Assuming you have the relevant tools installed, you can rebuild .rpms simply by running (as root)

<PRE>
rpm -ta dnsmasq-xxx.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
<H2>Configuration.</H2>
<H3>Simplest.</H3>
Put the address(es) of your ISP's DNS server(s) in /etc/resolv.conf on the 
firewall machine, and the names and internal network addresses of all your 
machines in /etc/hosts on the firewall machine.
 All the other machines on 
your network can simply have their own name and localhost in <TT>/etc/hosts
</TT> and 
should have the address of the firewall machine on the internal network as
the only nameserver in <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT>. For windows machines use the 
network applet in the control panel to set the address of the DNS server as the address of the firewall machine.
<H3>Caching for firewall.</H3>
If you want dnsmasq to cache DNS queries for the firewall machine also, simply 
put "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in /etc/resolv.conf. Put the real nameservers in 
another file, say /etc/resolv.dnsmasq, and use the -r command line flag to
make dnsmasq read that instead of /etc/resolv.conf.
<h3>Automatic DNS server configuration with PPP.</h3>
Later versions of pppd have an option "usepeerdns" which instructs it to write a file containing
the address(es) of the DNS severs in /etc/ppp/resolv.conf. Configure dnsmasq
as above with "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in /etc/resolv.conf and run dnsmasq 
with to option "-r /etc/ppp/resolv.conf".
<P>
On Redhat (at least versions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3) you can set pppd
options by adding "PPPOPTIONS=usepeerdns" to
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ippp0.  In the same file, make sure
that "PEERDNS=no" to stop RedHat's network initscripts from copying
/etc/ppp/resolv.conf into /etc/resolv.conf.

<h3>Automatic DNS server configuration with DHCP.</h3>
You need to get your DHCP client to write the addresse(s) of the DNS
servers to a file other than /etc/resolv.conf. For dhcpcd, the
dhcpcd.exe script gets run with the addresses of the nameserver(s) in
the shell variable <TT>$DNS</TT>. The following bit of shell script
uses that to write a file suitable for dnsmasq. 
<PRE>

echo -n >|/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf
dnsservs=${DNS/,/ }
for serv in $dnsservs; do
    echo "nameserver $serv" >>/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf
done

</PRE>
 
Remember to give dhcpcd the <TT>-R</TT> flag to stop it overwriting 
/etc/resolv.conf.

<P>
For other DHCP clients it should be possible to achieve the same effect.



<H2>Setting up a mailhub.</H2>
If you generate mail on the machines attached to your private network, you may
 be interested in the MX record feature of dnsmasq. This allows you to have all
 the machines on your network use your firewall or another machine as a "smarthost" and 
deliver mail to it. The details of how to set this up are highly dependent on
your mailer, system and distribution. (On Debian GNU/Linux, using the 
smail mailer, there's an option in the smailconfig program to set up this 
configuration.) The only thing that's relevant to dnsmasq is that the mailer 
needs to be able to interrogate the DNS and find an MX record for your mailhub.

<PRE>
dnsmasq -m mailhubname
</PRE>

By starting dnsmasq with the -m option
you instruct dnsmasq to server an MX record for <TT>mailhubname</TT>. 
By default the MX record 
points to the machine on which dnsmasq is running, so mail delivered to that
name will get sent to the mailer on your firewall machine. You can have the MX record point to another machine by using the -t command line flag.

<H2>Other configuration details.</H2>
dnsmasq writes its process-id into /var/run/dnsmasq.pid at startup. 
<P>
Sending SIGHUP to the dnsmasq process will cause it to empty it's cache and 
then re-load /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf.
<P> Sending SIGUSR1 (killall -10 dnsmasq) to the dnsmasq process will
cause to to write cache usage stats to the log, typically
/var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages.
<P> The -h option suppresses use of /etc/hosts.
<P> The -n option suppresses polling of /etc/resolv.conf.
<P>For a complete listing of options please take a look at the manpage
dnsmasq(8).
<P>If you installed dnsmasq as a debian package, the various options
can be set be editing /etc/init.d/dnsmasq.
<P>If you installed dnsmasq as an rpm package, set options by editing /etc/rc.d/init.d/dnsmasq
