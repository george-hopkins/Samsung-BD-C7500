	- fixed typo in README thanks to Micha Wiedenmann <mw-u2@gmx.de>
	- From Alexander E. Patrakov <patrakov@ums.usu.ru>
		Replaces ISAPNP hardware detection script with a better version

Mon Sep 20 2004 kroah
	- 2004_09_20 release
	- added README.modules to the makefile
	- added support for blacklists easier
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60214
	- ifrename is in /usr/sbin, not /sbin.
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46760
	- added isapnp support based on work from Simone Gotti
	  <simone.gotti@email.it> and Marco d'Itri
	- fix minor debug message in net.agent for Gentoo boxes
	- allow *.usermap to have blank lines. (patch from Francesco Ferrara
	  <ferrara@despammed.com>) at
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49748
	- add usbhid to the list of modules to unload on stop.
	- fix issue with input devices (joysticks specifically) not being
	  loaded properly. (lots of gentoo bug ids...)
	- fixed minor issue with usbfs being mounted but no host drivers loaded
	  yet <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56599>
	- From Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>
		- fix location of FIRMWARE_DIR to /lib/firmware
	- From Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com>
		- support a a TwinMos mobile disk, as per https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=111506
	- Posix compliant changes From David Weinehall <tao@kernel.org>
		- changes tests using `-o' and `-a' to use || and && respectively.
		- changes bash-specific functions to generic sh-functions, adds
		  a missing newline at the end of a file, does a few `-o'
		  substitutions and changes /bin/bash to /bin/sh, since the
		  changes removes the need to use /bin/bash.
		- Modifies the remaining non-bash scripts to remove use of the
		  bash:ism local (a quick audit shows that it's not needed),
		  substitutes `-a' and `-o', changes fgrep to grep -F (this
		  change is not strictly necessary, but recommended by the
		  POSIX standard), and one occurence of egrep to grep (since
		  this particular occurence didn't make use of extended regexps
		  anyway)
		- Modifies the remaining bash scripts to use generic
		  sh-functions instead of bash-specific functions, does `-a'
		  and `-o' substitutions, removes use of local, and finally
		  changes /bin/bash to /bin/sh
	- From Alexander E. Patrakov
		- Remove bogus dependency upon "which" and "usbmodules"
		  programs in 2.6 code path
		- Add README.modules file
		- Provide the correct DEVICE variable for USB coldplug events
		  for 2.6.x kernels. The grep ...\$ is used instead of tail -c 4 
		  because LFS has the tail command in /usr/bin. That's even
		  more illogical because head is in /bin.
		  This requires a 2.6.6 kernel. 2.6.4 is too old.

Thu Apr  1 2004 kroah

Thu Apr  1 2004 ukai
	- hotplug.functions: $MODULE need s/-/_/g to match with lsmod output
	- usb.agent: use $DEVPATH for $REMOVER if $DEVPATH is defined.
	   when coldplugging on 2.6.*, we don't know $DEVICE, but $DEVPATH,
	   so $DEVPATH should be used for unique string to device.
	
Web Mar 31 2004 ukai
	- input.agent: don't try to check empty $dev_bits in input_match_bits
	   some posix shell may complain on it.

			parameters
	- pci.rc: fix [: missing ']'
	
Thu Mar 11 2004 kroah
	- 2004_03_11 release
	- From Dmitry Torokhov <dtor_core@ameritech.net>:
		add evbug to the blacklist of modules
	- From Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>:
		We should mention the DEVPATH in the hotplug man page too,
		as someone missed it and got confused.
	- 5 patches from Marco d'Itri <md@Linux.IT>:
		- 000_small_fixes: fixed some small bugs.

		  enabling boot time events synthesis on lacking the
		  pcimodules program.
		- 004_2.6_usb_sysfs: improved sysfs support in the USB
		  scripts. Please review the changes marked with the FIXME
		  comment: this works on my system and others, but I'm not
		  sure that it's the proper way.

Fri Feb 13 2004 dbrownell

	  Borzenkov <arvidjaar@mail.ru>

Tue Oct 7 2003 kroah
	- keep already loaded modules from causing messages in the syslog.
	- added firmware.agent file from Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>
	- Lots of patches from Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com> to try to
	  sync back up with the Red Hat hotplug package:
		- hotplug-2003_08_05-networkdown.patch
		  Don't bring up network devices if the network service isn't
		  started.

		  Set IN_HOTPLUG environment variable as something users can
		  check in case they don't want some interface to be
		  automatically brought up.
		- hotplug-2003_08_05-updfstab.patch
		  Run updfstab on usb-storage insertion, and general removal
		  (Probably needs to run on firewire, and other sorts of
		  removal devices). upfstab is a Red Hat specific program that
		  edits /etc/fstab to add entries for removable devices.
	- added dasd (s390 stuff) tape and dasd agent files from SuSE and Red
	  Hat's hotplug package.

Wed Sep 24 2003 kroah

	- 2003_08_05 release

Sun Aug 3 2003 kroah
	- fix usb autoloading of modules for 2.6 (it wasn't working).

Fri Jun 27 2003 kroah
	- changed network code to accept 2.5's change to the way network
	  interfaces are brought up and down (now "add" and "remove" like all
	  the other hotplug types.)

Fri Jun 6 2003 dbrownell
    hotplug.functions fixes from:
	- Olaf Hering:  #!/bin/bash gone, VIM modeline,
	  logger location can vary, and should include PID
	- Ian Abbot: correct init of LOADED (fixes sf.net bug filing)
    Other sf.net bugs resolved
	- pointless pci.rc message [538243]
	- Makefile should ignore tape drives [578462]

Thu May 1 2003 kroah
	- 2003_05_01 release
	- made /sbin/hotplug a tiny multiplexer program, moving the original
	  /sbin/hotplug program to /etc/hotplug.d/default/default.hotplug
	- split the rpms generated into two: hotplug and hotplug-base.
	  hotplug-base contains /sbin/hotplug and /etc/hotplug.d/ only
	  hotplug contains everything else
	  hotplug depends on hotplug-base to be present to be able to be
	  loaded.

Thu Apr 17 2003 dbrownell
	- from Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>, firewire agent now loads
	  multiple modules.  video control and data can be separate.

Fri Jan 17 2003 dbrownell
	- call devlabel if it's present; <Gary_Lerhaupt@Dell.com>

Thu Dec 12 2002 dbrownell

Fri Nov 29 2002 dbrownell
	- initial scsi.agent for 2.5, modprobes sd_mod or sr_mod

Wed Nov 21 2002 dbrownell
    more updates for 2.5 kernels:
	- handle additional "device mode" usb hotplug, ignoring it for now
	  unless /sys/$DEVPATH/bNumConfigurations says we have choice of
	  configurations (the first one might not be best).
	- handle the improved "interface mode" usb hotplug in 2.5: don't
	  use 'usbmodules', each interface gets its own event report.
	- don't slow down usb hotplug, all hcds now do control queueing.
	- flag usb and pci 'coldplug' cleanups, needed now that we can
	  finally eliminate usbmodules (pcimodules too?)
    other fixes:
	- patch from <Reinhold.May@gmx.de> to address fact that usbmodules
	  can fail where the script parsing works
	- /sbin/hotplug can now save events to a logfile for later use,
	  suitable for debugging, collecting as test data, sending to a
	  daemon, and so on.
	- better fix for 'always run setup scripts', handling cases where
	  modprobe fails until the setup script renumerates to new usb ids.
	- usb.rc, comment the usbdevfs versioning issue (counting files in
	  /proc/bus/usb became fragile recently) and handle some similar
	  config-dependent startup issues

Tue Oct 1 2002 kroah
	- fix for the lack of a drivers file in usbfs in 2.5.  Patch is from
	  Duncan Sands <duncan.sands@wanadoo.fr>

	- update hotplug.8 manpage to mention Max'patch
	- patch from Max Krasnyanskiy, now  usb hotplugging also
	  searches /etc/hotplug/usb/*.usermap

Wed Sep 19 2001 kroah
	- 2001_09_19 release

Sun Sep 16 2001 kroah/dbrownell

	- Rework root makefile and hotplug.spec to install in prefix
	  location without need of spec file for install.

Fri Jun 8 2001  Stephen Williams  <steve@icarus.com>

	  directory, and updated the rpm spec file to match.

Thu Jun 6 2001 kroah
	- added half of Stephen Williams <steve@icarus.com> REMOVER
	  patch. It is up to the install script to create the
	  /var/run/usb directory.  Something like the following would be
	  enough:
	  	mkdir /var/run/usb
		chmod 0700 /var/run/usb

Tue Apr 24 2001 kroah
	- added debian directory filled with things needed to package 
	  the scripts for a debian release.

Tue Apr 03 2001 dbrownell
	- make sure setup scripts (for usermode drivers/apps) will
	  run even without a kernel driver

Fri Mar 30 2001 dbrownell
	- bugfix match_flags support from Gioele Barabuci; might
	  require bash2-isms

	  Tweaked the patch to handle different locations of the
	  'functions' script.
	  
Fri Feb 16 2001 kroah

	- added patch from Adam Richter that removes dependancy on /tmp
	  being writable.

Wed Feb 14 2001 kroah
	- 2001_02_14 release

Wed Feb 14 2001	dbrownell
	-  Fixes some problems seen with Redhat 7 systems when the  partial
	   USB setup in /etc/rc.sysinit was not disabled.  The failure mode
	   was that all USB modules got loaded, rather than only modules
	   for the devices that were connected.
 	-  In conjunction with the "usbmodules" and "pcimodules" patches to
	   "usbutils-0.7" and "pciutils-2.1.8", devices that are connected
	   at boot time will also be configured.  If you don't have those
	   utilities, you'll need to plug USB and CardBus devices in after
	   the system is booted, otherwise they can't be properly
	   configured.

Tue Jan 23 2001 kroah
	- 2001_01_23 release

Tue Jan 23 2001 dbrownell
	- log "ifup" invocations when debugging for net.agent script
