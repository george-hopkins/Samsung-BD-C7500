# Bcm3300 events
#
# As standard the CPU supports 4 performance counters.  
# Events 5,6,9,a,11,12,42,45,4b
# are available on all counters; 
#
# In this processor, events are grouped by module, only events from the same
# module can be used simultanously.
# Events 11, 12 can be used all the time.
# Events 5, 6 are in the Instruction cache module and can be used together.
# Events 9,a are in the Data cache module and can be used together.
# All other events, 42, 45, 4b must be used alone or only in conjunction with 11 and/or 12.
