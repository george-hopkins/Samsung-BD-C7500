# Bcm4350 events
#
# As standard the CPU supports 4 performance counters.  
# Events 5,6,9,10,17,18,66,69,75
# are available on all counters; 
#
# In this processor, events are grouped by module, only events from the same
# module can be used simultanously.
# Events 17, 18 can be used all the time.
# Events 5, 6 are in the Instruction cache module and can be used together.
# Events 9,10 are in the Data cache module and can be used together.
# All other events, 66,69,75 must be used alone or only in conjunction with 17 and/or 18.
