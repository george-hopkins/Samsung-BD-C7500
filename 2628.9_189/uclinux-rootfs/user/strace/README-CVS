If you use the CVS version of strace there will be some files missing
that you need to build strace. These files are generated by tools from
the GNU autoconf package.

In order to generate the missing package you can run the cvsbuild script.
For some architectures (powerpc, (ultra)sparc) you need a recent version
of autoconf, otherwise it might fail to recognize your system.
