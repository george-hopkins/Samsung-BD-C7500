xfsprogs-2.5.6 (19 August 2003)
	- Fix a mkfs problem where it could exit inappropriately when
	  a large data volume stripe unit was either specified on the
	  command line or via querying the underlying volume manager.

	  bfs probe code was broken for 64 bit machines (found by QA
	  test 032) and the hfs code was broken too (originally found
	  by Ethan Benson).  We now also detect hfs+ filesystems.

	  incorrectly processed.

xfsprogs-2.5.0 (18 June 2003)
	- Fix libdisk (and hence mkfs) code which warns on MD devices
	  with the clean flag not set, apparently this is not so wise.

	  write return values.
	- Fix error in xfs_io pwrite code with large request sizes.
	- Fix rounding-down-input problems in several xfs_io commands.
	- Changed mkfs.xfs default log size scaling algorithm slightly,
	  to create larger logs at smaller filesystem sizes by default
	  (thanks to Andi Kleen for the patch).
	- Enable support for sector sizes larger than 512 bytes.

xfsprogs-2.4.12 (02 June 2003)

	  stripe unit value was being passed to libxfs_clear_log.
	  All recent versions of xfs_repair will fix this, however,
	  because xfs_repair uses the correct stripe unit value.
	- Fix a bug in xfs_logprint, when dumping a corrupt log.
	- FreeBSD updates from Alexander Kabaev.
	- Large sector size updates for mkfs (disabled at the moment).

	- Rework configure.in to make use of shared macros.
	- Fix up #include lines to allow compilation of sources
	  with installed headers rather than local headers.
	- Fix botches in xfs_bmap shell script which prevented any
	  arguments being passed on to xfs_io (from Jan Derfinak).

	- Portability changes; including some code to support use
	  of several tools on Mac OS X (for Russell), ditto for
	  FreeBSD (from Russell); also did a simplistic backport
	  to IRIX (for me), so that I can run purify on some of
	  the tools.
	- See doc/INSTALL for more details on this.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.
	- Fix up some warnings when compiling libxfs on big endian

	  we don't check for the gettext tools (and no longer fails
	  if they were not found).
	- Added the ability to specify a different user and/or group
	  to install as (previously, and still by default, root/root
	  were always used here).

xfsprogs-2.4.3 (27 March 2003)
	- Cleanups to the build process, in particular the automatic

	- Added the xfs_io(8) command, an xfs_db(8) alike command
	  for testing and debugging the XFS file IO path.
	- Added an optional dependency on the GNU readline library
	  which is "off" by default and enabled with the configure
	  option --enable-readline=yes; it affects the interactive
	  tools only (xfs_db and now xfs_io).
	- Implemented xfs_bmap(8) as a shell script wrapper.
	- Documented the mkfs.xfs -f, -llogdev and -rrtdev options.

	- Fix error reporting when zeroing parts of the realtime
	  device in phase6 of xfs_repair.

	- Add an option to xfs_admin to use the above command.
	- Add command to xfs_db to print out the currently enabled
	  feature bits and version number.
	- Make xfs_db slightly more robust in the presense of bad

	  sector sizes (still plenty more to do here too).
	- Tidy up libxfs functions which take a "flags" argument.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in lib{xfs,xlog} and headers.
	- Fixed incorrect use of XFS_FSB_TO_DADDR macro in xfs_db's
	  faddr.c::fa_dirblock routine - now use XFS_FSB_TO_BB here,
	  as set_cur() takes basic blocks as its third parameter.
	- Fixed obscure issue in mkfs where only the first AG would
	  get its AGFL freelist "fixed" - not clear this caused any
	  issues in practice (on Linux its always been this way, we
	  now match up with IRIX though).
	- Made xfs_growfs filesystem geometry output match up with
	  that displayed by mkfs.xfs (xfs_growfs was missing a comma
	  before the log version field).
	- Fixed an issue in xfs_repair where data past the end of the
	  valid superblock fields was sometimes not cleared, when it
	  really should have been (due to a libxfs problem).
	- Shell scripts (xfs_info, xfs_check, etc) now also report
	  the xfsprogs version number via -V, like other commands.

	- Fix mkfs (libxfs) bug when using BLKFLSBUF ioctl - we passed
	  in the device number instead of a file descriptor (and EBADF
	  was the end result, which we ignored).
	- Thanks to Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org> for fixing this.

xfsprogs-2.3.4 (04 October 2002)
	- Fix size calculation bug in xfs_repair's memory allocation,
	  reduces memory usage by a factor of 4.

	- Fix endian bug in xfs_db, was not flipping 16-bit numbers.
	- Make xfs_repair recognize a NULLFSINO and print that in
	  addition to "18446744073709551615" for easy recognition.
	- Fix format string that xfs_repair uses when fixing inodes,
	  so that the new inode numbers are printed correctly.

xfsprogs-2.2.1 (09 August 2002)
	- Fix buglet in libdisk get_driver_block_major() routine which
	  would result in incorrect majors being returned for not-found
	  drivers.
	- Fix problem in install process with newer autoconf versions.

xfsprogs-2.2.0 (08 August 2002)
	- mkfs.xfs defaults to a blocksize of 4096 bytes, and no longer

	- Fix up log stripe unit specification options, and update
	  man page.  Also fix suffix handling for data su/sw options

	- Automatically select v2 logs if a log stripe unit is
	  specified.

xfsprogs-2.1.1 (04 July 2002)
	- Build infrastructure updates so that configure options can be
	  used to specify paths rather than semi-hard-coded path names
	  controlled by the ROOT/ROOT_PREFIX environment variables; eg.
	  now allows /lib64 and /lib32

	- Don't build libxlog.a with DEBUG enabled
	- xfs_db fixes from ASANO Masahiro at NEC

	  swabbing in libxfs code)

xfsprogs-2.0.3 (13 April 2002)

	  tripping asserts in additional libxfs debug code.

xfsprogs-2.0.2 (04 April 2002)
	- Bumped version of libhandle to libhandle.so.1.0.1
	  This changes open_by_handle() and friends so that 
	  O_LARGEFILE is added to the open flags.
	  This allows xfsdump to dump files greater than
	  2^31-1 bytes instead of not dumping the large
	  files and giving warning messages.

xfsprogs-1.3.13 (25 October 2001)
	- fix bug in mkfs for 1Tbyte + filesystems

	- implement the -f (file) option to xfs_logprint
	- rework the xlog code into libxlog for code sharing

	  lvdisplay program to get volume geometry (mkp@mkp.net)
	- fix bug in LVM driver wrapper where it would not have been
	  used at all, ever (since 1.3.0), due to idiot programmer
