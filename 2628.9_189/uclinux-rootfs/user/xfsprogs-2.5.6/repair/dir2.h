/*
 * the cursor gets passed up and down the da btree processing
 * routines.  The interior block processing routines use the
 * cursor to determine if the pointers to and from the preceding
 * and succeeding sibling blocks are ok and whether the values in
 * the current block are consistent with the entries in the parent
 * nodes.  When a block is traversed, a parent-verification routine
 * is called to verify if the next logical entry in the next level up
 * is consistent with the greatest hashval in the next block of the
 * current level.  The verification routine is itself recursive and
 * calls itself if it has to traverse an interior block to get
 * the next logical entry.  The routine recurses upwards through
 * the tree until it finds a block where it can simply step to
 * the next entry.  The hashval in that entry should be equal to
 * the hashval being passed to it (the greatest hashval in the block
 * that the entry points to).  If that isn't true, then the tree
 * is blown and we need to trash it, salvage and trash it, or fix it.
 * Currently, we just trash it.
