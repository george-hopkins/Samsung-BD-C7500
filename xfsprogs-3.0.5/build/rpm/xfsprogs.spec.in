%description
A set of commands to use the XFS filesystem, including mkfs.xfs.

XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
and scalability.

Refer to the documentation at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/
for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible
with the IRIX version of XFS.

%description devel
xfsprogs-devel contains the libraries and header files needed to
develop XFS filesystem-specific programs.

You should install xfsprogs-devel if you want to develop XFS
filesystem-specific programs,  If you install xfsprogs-devel, you'll
also want to install xfsprogs.
